# Angry-Bird-CGL_Winter_Workshop

- Greetings, I'm Aman Kumar.
- I'm developing a game that is similar to Angry Birds.
- I decided to develop Angry Bird as my first Game of Game Development with some improvisation because it is a popular game and I used to play it in my childhood, and it holds many memories for me. Additionally, it will help me to learn more about the Unity environment.
- Free Adobe Stocks are utilised for the characters.
- There are now just three levels in my game, which has not yet been fully changed. I will release the finished product later.
- You can play my most recent modified efforts by downloading the built game folder.
