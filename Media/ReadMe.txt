Hello , this is Aman Kumar
I am working on a game similar to Angry Bird ,
i choose this game because it is a simple and well known game 
so by doing this i will become familiar with unity environment and also familiar with the basics of C# .

Characters are used from free adobe stocks .
Currently my game is not completely modified , i will upload the modified work later.

You can downlaod the build game folder and play my last modified works.
